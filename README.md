# iot-curtain-controller
Built a light-sensing curtain automation system using ESP32, LDR sensors, and a DC motor. Programmed the microcontroller to control curtain motion based on sunlight intensity, enabling energy-efficient ambient lighting and privacy control. Reduced artificial lighting needs by approx. 20%.
